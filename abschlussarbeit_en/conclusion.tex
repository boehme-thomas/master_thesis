\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{c:conclusion}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the conclusion, you summarize your most important findings and contribution.
It is generally a good idea to keep this short, e.g., 1 page for conclusions
and 1-2 pages for an outlook (\enquote{What should be done next?}).
But make sure to check these recommendations with your supervisor.
